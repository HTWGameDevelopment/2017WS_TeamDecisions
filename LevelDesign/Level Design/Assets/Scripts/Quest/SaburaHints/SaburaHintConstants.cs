    public static string CLUES_MUSHROOM = "Do you see all the mushrooms I planted? Aren´t they awesome? They also grow in the forest. When an alchemist uses them in the correct way, they can create an elixir which is able to manipulate memories. I documented the whole procedure, but the documents got stolen a while ago";
    public static string CLUES_ENEM = "What the hell is this amount of Enem I am sensing? Oh, sorry for the delayed introduction. I am a person capable of sensing the amount of Enem of a person just by being near to them. The girl behind you has an unexplainable amount of Enem I cant even sense her limit. This is literally uncomparable to every other being. Be careful there. There are rumors that people around the place where the undeads live got their Enem drained and died as a result.";
    public static string CLUES_PHOTOALBUM = "A photoalbum containing pictures of Sabura. They show him and his family and friends on his homeplanet. It seems to be really important to him, considering its his only belonging in his house. Neither you or Aura are in it... ";

    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG1_1_3_CHOICE1 = "You would endanger Aura for that. I cant forgive you! (Attack Sabura)";
    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG1_1_3_CHOICE2 = "Lets find a way together to return to our homeworlds, okay? We can still be friends";
    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG2_TEXT = "Hahaha, I didnt laugh that hard for a while. I cant be asked to play along with you playing detective. Farewell";
    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG1_1_1_TEXT = "You wouldnt be able to kill me in the first place. First of all calm down";

    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG1_1_1_CHOICE2 = "I cant bring myself to attack you. I am going. Farewell, it was only for a short time, but this time was precious to me";
    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG1_2_TEXT = "Yeah I was. I dont need to hide it any longer. I was just using both of you. If you want more information follow me to Owaria. I will get rid of both of you there. There are to many people who could interfere here. ";
    public static string SABURA_EXPOSE_EVENT_DIALOG1_1_3_TEXT = "I was just desperate! Do you know how hard it is for me not being able to return to my home? And then I met that man who promised me to bring me back to my world.";
