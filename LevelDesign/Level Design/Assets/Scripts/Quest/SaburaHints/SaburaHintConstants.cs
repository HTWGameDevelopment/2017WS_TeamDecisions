    public static string CLUES_MUSHROOM = "Do you see all the mushrooms I planted? Aren´t they awesome? They also grow in the forest. When an alchemist uses them in the correct way, they can create an elixir which is able to manipulate memories. I documented the whole procedure, but the documents got stolen a while ago";
    public static string CLUES_ENEM = "What the hell is this amount of Enem I am sensing? Oh, sorry for the delayed introduction. I am a person capable of sensing the amount of Enem of a person just by being near to them. The girl behind you has an unexplainable amount of Enem I cant even sense her limit. This is literally uncomparable to every other being. Be careful there. There are rumors that people around the place where the undeads live got their Enem drained and died as a result.";
    public static string CLUES_PHOTOALBUM = "A photoalbum containing pictures of Sabura. They show him and his family and friends on his homeplanet. It seems to be really important to him, considering its his only belonging in his house. Neither you or Aura are in it... ";
    public static string CLUES_DEVICE = "Hey traveler! If you stay on the road you will reach our town, Kiashi. Check out our market! There are even specialists selling parts with which you can build a device capable of collecting and storing Enem";
    public static string ATTACK_SABURA = " Sabura fled after being heavily wounded. He went to Owaria. You should follow him...";
